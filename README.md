## Django Demo Task (Edutech)
This is simple website for storing and searching question generally usefull for students.
<br />
### Task
You have to develop the 3-4 core functionalities  for the  HOMEPAGE of an Edutech website. Link of the mockups for this home page is given below. This home page is a for doubt solving website for school students in India in their local language. Feel free to show your creativity but you have to make a simple yet attractive website by writing neat & clean code. We will judge your skill set on the basis of your backend / database work. Hence, you can just work on a few parts of the frontend. Don't try to make a complete website. 3 -4 featuers are more than enough. You are free to decide features on your own. There are no restriction from our side for the feature selection.

### My View About The Site:
As mention in task area I will explain functionalities of the site below. But few things I want to as short of time some functionalities of the site are not been completed so I will mention functionalities below with future improvement and limitations.

### F1:
#### Functionalities
Website has langauge options of english/hindi.
#### Limitation
Language only support for static content in html. But as site mostly made of dynamic content like django forms and models, so translation dosn't support for those but it could be done if more time were given.

### F2:
#### Functionalities
Can Ask question / post question, and also has taggit functionalities.
Ex: title: 'What is electrochemistry?' description: 'some desc' tags:'chemistry, electrochemistry'
#### Limitation
For now it's normal html text area, but using third party web editor it could be improvemented.
